// Package component has the interfaces for all the components that
// can be implemented. A component is the broad term used to describe
// all builders, platforms, registries, etc.
//
// Many component interfaces have functions named `XFunc` where "X" is some
// operation and the return value is "interface{}". These functions should return
// a method handle to the function implementing that operation. This pattern is
// done so that we can support custom typed operations that take and return
// full rich types for an operation. We use a minimal dependency-injection
// framework (see internal/mapper) to call these functions.
